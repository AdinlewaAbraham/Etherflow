Welcome to Etherflow, a decentralized application (dapp) for making Ethereum transactions and visualizing your transaction history with added functionality of adding beneficiaries for reoccurring transactions.

The main feature of Etherflow is the ability to add beneficiaries for reoccurring transactions, make Ethereum transactions directly from the dapp, and track your transaction history using React Chart 2, providing a graphical representation of your transaction data. It also displays your wallet balance in Ether and USD.

Etherflow is deployed to the Goerli testnet, so you will need to have a MetaMask wallet connected to the Goerli network to interact with the dapp.

You can try out the dapp on the following link: https://etherflow-adinlewaabraham.vercel.app/

Please note that as a dapp, Etherflow runs on the Ethereum blockchain, so you will need to pay gas fees for transactions. Additionally, please be aware that the project is still in development and may contain bugs.

We welcome any contributions and feedback on the GitHub repository. If you have any questions or concerns, please open an issue and we will respond as soon as possible.

Thank you for trying Etherflow!
